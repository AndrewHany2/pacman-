# Playing Pac-Man game

![Pac-Man game](pacman_game.gif)

The Pac-Man projects were developed for [UC Berkeley's introductory artificial intelligence course, CS 188](http://ai.berkeley.edu/project_overview.html). They apply an array of AI techniques to playing Pac-Man. However, these projects don't focus on building AI for video games. Instead, they teach foundational AI concepts, such as informed state-space search, probabilistic inference, and reinforcement learning. These concepts underly real-world application areas such as natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics.

# Using Pac-Man in your AI Course
You are welcome to use the Pac-Man projects and infrastructure for any educational or personal use. We ask only that you:

1. Please do not distribute or post solutions to any of the projects.
2. Please retain the attribution text at the top of each Python file.
3. Talk to us before re-releasing, repacking, or extending the projects.

Additionally, if you have any questions, feedback, or bug reports about our projects, there are two ways of getting them addressed. (1) An public instructor forum through Piazza, in which you will need to contact us to get an access code to join, and (2) a private form linked here (preferably for bug reports). For more information, see the [Contact](http://ai.berkeley.edu/contact.html) section.
